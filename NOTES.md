## Missed or misrepresented superscripts and subscripts

### High level conclusions
For text parsed from PDFs, the subscripts and superscripts are generally accurate. There are a handful of typos, however, as described next.

Where most of the issues stem from is from superscripts and subscripts used within a table - that is very inaccurate.

### [subscript superscript text.pdf](example_pdfs/subscript superscript text.pdf)
